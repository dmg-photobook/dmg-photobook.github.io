By tracking participants through up to five games of five rounds each, the PhotoBook dataset allows for investigating both in-game and inter-game effects. An in-depth analysis of both of these dimensions can be found in chapter 5 of Janosch Haber's Master's Thesis

The following sections will highlight some of the central features and observations of the PhotoBook Dataset. <br /><br />

<h2 id="in-game">In-Game Analysis</h2>

In this section we focus on the analysis of participants’ interaction during a game of five labelling
rounds. Our data here largely confirms the observations concerning participants’ task efficiency
and language use during a multi-round communication task made by seminal, small-scale experiments such as those by Krauss and Weinheimer
(1964); Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986); Brennan
and Clark (1996) and, due to its scale, offers additional aspects for further investigation.<br /><br />

<h3>Task Efficiency</h3>

 <span class="image main"><img src="images/analysis_1.png" alt="" /></span>

Completing the first round of the PhotoBook task
takes participants an average of almost three minutes. Completing the fifth round on the other hand
takes them about half that time. As Figure 1a
shows, this decline roughly follows a negative logarithmic function, with significant differences between rounds 1, 2, 3 and 4, and plateauing towards
the last round. The number of messages sent by
participants as well as the average message length
follow a similar pattern, significantly decreasing
between consecutive game rounds. The average
number of correct image labels, on the other hand,
significantly increases between the first and last
round of the game (cf. the red dashed graph in Figure 1a). As a result, <b>task efficiency as calculated
by points per minute significantly increases with
each game round.</b> <br /><br />

<h3>Linguistic Properties of Utterances</h3>
 
To get a better understanding of how participants
increase task efficiency and shorten their utterances, we analyse how the linguistic characteristics of messages change over a game.
We calculated a normalised content word ratio
by dividing the count of content words by the total token count. This results in an almost linear
increase of content tokens over total token ratio
throughout a game (average Pearson’s r per game
of 0.34, p < 0.05, see Figure 1b). <br /><br />

With referring expressions and messages in general getting
shorter, content words thus appear to be favoured
to remain. We also observe that participants reuse
these content words. Figure 1c shows the number of novel content tokens per game round, which
roughly follows a negative logarithmic function.
This supports the hypothesis of participants establishing a conceptual pact on the referring expression attached to a specific referent: <b>Once accepted,
a referring expression is typically refined through
shortening rather than by reformulating or adding
novel information</b> (cf., Brennan and Clark, 1996).<br /><br />

We also analysed in more detail the distribution of word classes per game round by tagging
messages with the NLTK POS-Tagger. Figure 1d
displays the relative changes in content-word-class
usage between the first round and last round of a
game. All content word classes but verbs show a
relative increase in occurrence, most prominently
nouns with a 20% relative increase. The case of
adverbs, which show a 12% relative increase, is
particular: Manual examination showed that most
adverbs are not used to described images but rather
to flag that a given image has already appeared before or to confirm/reject (‘again’ and ‘too’ make
up 21% of all adverb occurrences; about 36% are
‘not’, ‘n’t’ and ‘yes’). <br /><br />

These results indicate that
<b>interlocutors are most likely to retain the nouns
and adjectives of a developing referring expression, while increasingly dropping verbs, as well
as prepositions and determiners.</b> A special role
here takes definite determiner ‘the’, which, in spite
of the stark decline of determiners in general, increases by 13% in absolute occurrence counts between the first and last round of a game, suggesting a shift towards known information. <br /><br />

Finally, in contrast to current visual dialogue
datasets (Das et al., 2017; De Vries et al., 2017)
which exclusively contain sequences of questionanswer pairs, the PhotoBook dataset includes
diverse dialogue acts. Qualitative examination
shows that, not surprisingly, a large proportion
of messages include an image description. These
descriptions however are interleaved with <b>clarification questions, acceptances/rejections, and acknowledgements</b>. <br /><br />

<h2 id="inter-game">Inter-Game Analysis</h2>

<b>The PhotoBook task was completed by pairs of a total of 1514 unique
workers</b>, of which 472 only completed a single game, 448 completed
between two and four games and 594 the maximum of five games (see
Figure 2a for a full overview). <br /><br />

<span class="image main"><img src="images/analysis_2.png" alt="" /></span>

Completing a full five-round game took an average of 14.2 minutes, with
times ranging from 4 minutes to some scattered outliers of up to 53
minutes (see Figure 2b). Grouping games by the order in which they were completed by the
participants, we follow Brennan and Clark (1996) and investigate the
effect of participants completing multiple consecutive games. Similar to
their results, Figure 2c shows that <b>the average game time decreases per
subsequent game in the PhotoBook task</b> as well.<br /><br />

<h3>Scores</h3>

With three highlighted images per player per round, during a full game
of five rounds 30 labelling decisions have to be made. On average,
participants correctly label 28.62 out of these 30. <b>39% of all games
reached full scores</b>, and only 1.2% of all completed games did not
reach our pre-set minimum score of 24 points (see Figure 3a).<br /><br /> 

<span class="image main"><img src="images/analysis_3.png" alt="" /></span>

Investigating the game scores obtained in subsequent games (Figure
3b), we can observe a slight drop in game score between the first
and second game, followed by a continuous increase in score until
they surpass the first game’s score in the fourth one. All of these
relative changes in game score however are below significance level
when compared to the respective previous game score.
Filtering all games of participants that did not complete the full set of
five games results in a convex graph, with the third game scoring
lowest (Figure 3c, all relative changes
with respect to the previous game’s scores are non-significant).<br /><br />

<h3>Order of Selections</h3>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/analysis_4.png" alt="" /></span>


Figure 4 shows the distribution of games where the nth selection
per game round was either an image that was selected in a previous
round or a selection of an image that was selected for the first time
during that round. While an in-depth comparison of these statistics per
round is a non-trivial endeavour because the percentage of previously
selected pictures increases throughout a game (given the limited set
of candidate images in a game), the graph clearly shows that <b>within a
single game round participants tend to first select (and therefore refer
to) images that were selected in a previous round already</b>, and only later
turn to those images that need to be selected for the first time. This
preference holds throughout all later rounds of the game.<br /><br />

<h3>Linguistic Analysis</h3>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/analysis_5.png" alt="" /></span>


The figures above show a sample of the in-depth lignuistic analysis of the PhotoBook dataset reported in Janosch Haber's thesis. The left figure for example displays the ten most frequent words succeeding a determiner, together with a distribution of the n-grams succeeding them. Persons and colours here seem to play a central role in developing image descriptions and re-references. In order to further investigate any structural differences in descriptions and references, we split the n-grams into two
groups, one succeeding indefinite determiners (center) and those
following a definite determiner (right). In the former case
the distribution is very similar to that of the overlall most frequent words in 5a. In the latter case we however can observe
some differences to the other two distributions with tri-grams starting
with ’one’ and ’same’ entering the top 10. Both of them indicate references
to previously seen images (i.e. ’the one with the big teddy bear’ or ’the same red bus as last round’).
