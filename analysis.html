By tracking participants through up to five games of five rounds each, the PhotoBook dataset allows for investigating both in-game and inter-game effects. An in-depth analysis of both of these dimensions can be found in chapter 5 of Janosch Haber's Master's Thesis

<h2 id="in-game">In-Game Analysis</h2>

In this section we focus on the analysis of participants’ interaction during a game of five labelling
rounds. Our data here largely confirms the observations concerning participants’ task efficiency
and language use during a multi-round communication task made by seminal, small-scale experiments such as those by Krauss and Weinheimer
(1964); Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986); Brennan
and Clark (1996) and, due to its scale, offers additional aspects for further investigation.<br /><br />

<h3>Task Efficiency</h3>

 <span class="image main"><img src="images/analysis_1.png" alt="" /></span>

Completing the first round of the PhotoBook task
takes participants an average of almost three minutes. Completing the fifth round on the other hand
takes them about half that time. As Figure 1a
shows, this decline roughly follows a negative logarithmic function, with significant differences between rounds 1, 2, 3 and 4, and plateauing towards
the last round. The number of messages sent by
participants as well as the average message length
follow a similar pattern, significantly decreasing
between consecutive game rounds. The average
number of correct image labels, on the other hand,
significantly increases between the first and last
round of the game (cf. the red dashed graph in Figure 1a). As a result, <b>task efficiency as calculated
by points per minute significantly increases with
each game round.</b> <br /><br />

<h3>Linguistic Properties of Utterances</h3>
 
To get a better understanding of how participants
increase task efficiency and shorten their utterances, we analyse how the linguistic characteristics of messages change over a game.
We calculated a normalised content word ratio
by dividing the count of content words by the total token count. This results in an almost linear
increase of content tokens over total token ratio
throughout a game (average Pearson’s r per game
of 0.34, p < 0.05, see Figure 1b). <br /><br />

With referring expressions and messages in general getting
shorter, content words thus appear to be favoured
to remain. We also observe that participants reuse
these content words. Figure 1c shows the number of novel content tokens per game round, which
roughly follows a negative logarithmic function.
This supports the hypothesis of participants establishing a conceptual pact on the referring expression attached to a specific referent: <b>Once accepted,
a referring expression is typically refined through
shortening rather than by reformulating or adding
novel information</b> (cf., Brennan and Clark, 1996).<br /><br />

We also analysed in more detail the distribution of word classes per game round by tagging
messages with the NLTK POS-Tagger. Figure 1d
displays the relative changes in content-word-class
usage between the first round and last round of a
game. All content word classes but verbs show a
relative increase in occurrence, most prominently
nouns with a 20% relative increase. The case of
adverbs, which show a 12% relative increase, is
particular: Manual examination showed that most
adverbs are not used to described images but rather
to flag that a given image has already appeared before or to confirm/reject (‘again’ and ‘too’ make
up 21% of all adverb occurrences; about 36% are
‘not’, ‘n’t’ and ‘yes’). <br /><br />

These results indicate that
<b>interlocutors are most likely to retain the nouns
and adjectives of a developing referring expression, while increasingly dropping verbs, as well
as prepositions and determiners.</b> A special role
here takes definite determiner ‘the’, which, in spite
of the stark decline of determiners in general, increases by 13% in absolute occurrence counts between the first and last round of a game, suggesting a shift towards known information. <br /><br />

Finally, in contrast to current visual dialogue
datasets (Das et al., 2017; De Vries et al., 2017)
which exclusively contain sequences of questionanswer pairs, the PhotoBook dataset includes
diverse dialogue acts. Qualitative examination
shows that, not surprisingly, a large proportion
of messages include an image description. These
<b>descriptions however are interleaved with clarification questions, acceptances/rejections, and acknowledgements</b>. <br /><br />
